    "**Code Description**\n",
    "In this project, the algorithm can estimate the pulse rate from the signals of ppg sensor and accelerators. The signals data should be saved in .mat files. Providing the paths of files, pulse rate in every 2 seconds will be calculated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Description**\n",
    "The signals are taken from the Troika dataset. The original dataset has 2-channels PPG signals, 1-channel ECG signal and 3-axis accelerator signals. But, only 1 PPG signals and 3 accelerator signals are used in this project. In order to have a more complicated algorithm, the full dataset can be used. In addition, other data like position from GPS can also be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithhm Description**\n",
    "The algorithm transforms the PPG signal from time domain to frequency domain. Frequency with the highest amplitude is the estimated pulse rate. The PPG signals were affected by the arm motion. So, the vibration rate were also esitmated from the accelerators signals. If the estimated pulse rate and the vibration rate are equal, the next strongest frequency in PPG signal is the estimated pulse.\n",
    "The pulse rate were estimated in every 2 seconds. The corresponding condifence level and error were also calculated. If the pulse rate was the same as the frequency of the arm motion, the algorithm may reject the estimated reuslt and select a wrong pulse rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Performance**\n",
    "The confidence value was estimated by the sum of amplitude near the peak in frequency domain over the whole spectrum. The highest the confidence value the better the estimated pulse rate is. The error between the ground-truth and the estimated pulse rate was calculated. In this dataset, the mean error of the best 90% of estimates is 7.4 BPM. The result is not bad. It is believed that the algorithm can be applied to other datasets.\n"
